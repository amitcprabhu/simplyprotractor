      <span>As javascript today’s one of the growing application development technology. Before we start understanding today's powerful programming language javascript. We need to find the past of javascript. Javascript is not a very new programming language. It was also introduced in late nineties like java. But it was introduced as scripting language only for browser activities and validation. In other words javascript only execute or run in browser. Or I want to add this way javascript is the only one scripting language which can get executed in browser. So javascript was having good popularity. On one fine day in 2009 one person name “Ryan Dahl” has created compiler of javascript with the help of google chrome v8 engine. 
This is known as nodejs. 
After nodejs comes into picture we can easily compile and run javascript application code on any operating system.<br /> 
Some feature of javascript :<ol>
<li>Javascript coding style similar like C, C++, java or C#.</li>
<li>File extension .js</li>
<li>Javascript is not purely object oriented language like java or C#. But you may or may not use oops in javascript. So we do have option as per the application we can take call whether I can go for more on OOPS or not.</li>
<li>It is dynamically typed programming language not like java or C#. there are typesafe programming language.</li></ol>
